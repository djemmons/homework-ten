### this is a basic layout of the xd file given in class trying to use jquery
### COMMENT: I tried a bunch of different ways to make the other links work (EX: the navigation and I couldnt get it to work properly and not have two different navs showing up at the same time so i took the code away because it made it look tacky and not work at all)
