### this is a basic layout of the xd file given in class trying to use jquery
### If you reaload the page each time you click a new page it will work, i wouldnt get the nav to work properly as explained below.
### COMMENT: I tried a bunch of different ways to make the other links work (EX: the navigation and I couldnt get it to work properly and not have two different navs showing up at the same time so i took the code away because it made it look tacky and not work at all)
